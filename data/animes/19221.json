    "synopsis": "Kanade Amakusa is a high school student who is suffering from a curse called \"Absolute Choices.\" This curse requires him to select an action from a list of two or three options that appear before him at any time, and has no control over what choices appear. Many of them are weird or perverse and as a result, the curse has tainted his reputation with his classmates and other people around him, making his life very difficult. However, one day, a choice he makes on his way home from school causes a mysterious, beautiful young girl to fall from the sky.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
