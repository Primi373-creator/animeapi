    "synopsis": "Sana Kurata has a charmed life. Not only is her mother a famous, award-winning writer, but she's the star of the hit TV comedy \"Child's Toy\" while still in the fifth grade. But Sana's biggest concern is Akito Hayama, a pint-sized hellion who's organized the boys in their grade-school class into a mass of unending noise and violence. With the help of Rei, her manager, chauffeur and \"pimp,\" Sana is determined to win back control of the classroom from her new arch-enemy. But as her crusade continues, Sana moves further into Akito's life, and finds that he might not be entirely bad...or entirely safe.",
