Toiling endlessly at burger joints and tea ceremonies, the innocent Kyouko remains unaware that day in day out, all her tireless efforts have been taken for granted, until, one day, she finds out that her beloved Shou sees her as nothing but a free servant.

As she steps into this new life, Kyouko will face new challenges as well as people who will push her out of her comfort zone.",
