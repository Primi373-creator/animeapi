    "synopsis": "Every teenager has undergone the awkwardness of high school. Making new friends and trying to fit in. It's hard enough doing so under normal circumstances. Try doing so with blonde hair and a bad boy face... in Japan. After transferring to a new school, Kodaka Hasegawa was instantaneously labelled a \"delinquent\" due to his eccentric appearance. Having classmates shiver in your presence is not a good way to start the school year.",
