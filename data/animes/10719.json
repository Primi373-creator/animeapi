    "synopsis": "Every teenager has undergone the awkwardness of high school. Making new friends and trying to fit in. It's hard enough doing so under normal circumstances. Try doing so with blonde hair and a bad boy face... in Japan. After transferring to a new school, Kodaka Hasegawa was instantaneously labelled a \"delinquent\" due to his eccentric appearance. Having classmates shiver in your presence is not a good way to start the school year.\n\nOne day, Kodaka has a surprise encounter with a female classmate, Yozora, who just might be more of an outcast than him - she has both a bad temper and an imaginary friend. However, even outcasts desire companionship. The two decide to form the \"Neighbors' Club,\" specifically designed for people who don't have many friends. Kodaka, a lone wolf in the wild terrains of high school, had finally found his pack. But will this dysfunctional bunch be able to form normal relationships with each other? Or will their unique personalities collide?\n\nBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a slice of life anime that portrays the difficulties of fitting in and making friends in a comedic and heartwarming way. Viewers can't help but root for these adorable underdogs.",
