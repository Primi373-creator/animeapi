    "synopsis": "Tenma Tsukamoto is a friendly and childish high school student who has always been in love with her enigmatic classmate Karasuma Ooji. However, she is too shy and nervous to tell him how she truly feels while he remains completely oblivious to her interest. On the other hand, Tenma’s other classmate, Kenji Harima, secretly admires Tenma but he is, in the same way, unable to confess. He also happens to be the most notorious delinquent of the school and comes to classes only to be close to Tenma.",
