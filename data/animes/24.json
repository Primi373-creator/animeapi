    "synopsis": "Tenma Tsukamoto is a friendly and childish high school student who has always been in love with her enigmatic classmate Karasuma Ooji. However, she is too shy and nervous to tell him how she truly feels while he remains completely oblivious to her interest. On the other hand, Tenma’s other classmate, Kenji Harima, secretly admires Tenma but he is, in the same way, unable to confess. He also happens to be the most notorious delinquent of the school and comes to classes only to be close to Tenma.\n\nThe hilarious love triangle results in a series of misunderstandings which make it unclear to understand who is infatuated with whom and what is true or false. Is Kenji going to finally confess to Tenma? Is Tenma going to convey her feelings to Karasuma? Or perhaps, they are not really destined to be together after all?",
