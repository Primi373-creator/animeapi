    "synopsis": "The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective \"future gadgets\" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed \"Daru.\" The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the \"Phone Microwave,\" which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.",
