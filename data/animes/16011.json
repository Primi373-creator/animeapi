    "synopsis": "During World War II, Japan sought to turn the tide of the war through the use of magic and enlisted the aid of Yakou Tsuchimikado, a genius user of onmyodo magic. However, something went amiss near the end of the war. A ritual gone wrong caused what would be known as the “Great Disaster” and left Tokyo as a hotbed of spiritual activity from that point on.",
