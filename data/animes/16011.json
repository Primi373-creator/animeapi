    "synopsis": "During World War II, Japan sought to turn the tide of the war through the use of magic and enlisted the aid of Yakou Tsuchimikado, a genius user of onmyodo magic. However, something went amiss near the end of the war. A ritual gone wrong caused what would be known as the “Great Disaster” and left Tokyo as a hotbed of spiritual activity from that point on.\n\nOver fifty years later, Tokyo Ravens begins when Harutora Tsuchimikado, a member of the prestigious Tsuchimikado family born without the ability to sense spiritual power, is attacked by Suzuka, a powerful onmyodo-user. She mistakenly believes him to be the heir of the Tsuchimikado family and intends to enact the very same ritual that led to the “Great Disaster” in the past. In order to defeat her, Harutora fulfills a childhood promise he made to Natsume, the true heir of their family, and he becomes her familiar to aid her in a battle between onmyouji.",
