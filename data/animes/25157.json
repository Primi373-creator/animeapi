    "synopsis": "“Awaken now, Kasuga Arata.” With those words, Arata’s uneventful, carefree life ends forever. A black shadow covers the sun and Arata’s entire town is reduced to rubble, all the people in it spirited away by the blackness of the sun in an event called a \"breakdown phenomenon\". As Arata’s memories come flooding back, he realizes he’s been living inside an illusion created by a powerful book of spells.",
