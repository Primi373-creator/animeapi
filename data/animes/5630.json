    "synopsis": "College student Saki Morimi is on a trip in the United States at what she believes to be the center of the world, Washington, DC. While at the White House, she has a misunderstanding with the local police, only to be bailed out by a stark naked young man who is brandishing a gun and a phone! During this timeframe, on the other side of the world, Japan has suffered a missile attack.\n\nThe young man she meets is Akira Tokizawa. He's a Seleção, one of twelve individuals participating in a game that involves “saving” Japan. He has ¥8.2 billion in digital currency left in his phone to use as he deems necessary. If the money is squandered, or the mission is failed, then he will be eliminated.\n\nAs Higashi no Eden unfolds, Akira will meet the other Seleção, including a serial killer and a police detective, and discover what really happened during the “Careless Monday” terrorist attack, along with the reason why his memories were wiped.",
