    "synopsis": "Striking fear into the hearts of mortals, the Demon Lord Satan rules the land of Ente Isla with an iron fist. Embarking upon a brutal conquest to take over the continent, his efforts are foiled by the hero Emilia who initiates his swift retreat through a dimensional portal. Alongside his loyal general, Alsiel, Satan finds himself stranded in modern-day Tokyo, vowing to return to his own world and continue his reign of terror once more.....that is, if they can find a way back!\n\nPowerless in a world without magic, Satan assumes the guise of a human named Sadao Maou and begins working at MgRonald's—a local fast-food restaurant—to make ends meet. He soon realizes that his goal of conquering Ente Isla is just not enough as he grows determined to climb the corporate ladder and become the ruler of Earth, one satisfied customer at a time!\n\nWhether it's part-time work, household chores, or simply trying to pay the rent on time, Hataraku Maou-sama! presents a hilarious view of the most mundane aspects of everyday life, all through the eyes of a hapless Demon Lord.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
