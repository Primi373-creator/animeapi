    "synopsis": "Rescued from a hellish inferno as a child and taught the art of magecraft by Kiritsugu Emiya, Shirou Emiya idolized his adoptive father. After his father's untimely death, Shirou vowed to follow in his footsteps and fight for the good of the world.\n\nYears later, Shirou lingers at his school after nightfall and comes across a battle being waged by two superhuman beings known as Servants. When one of these Servants tries to kill him, Shirou ends up summoning a Servant of his own, a knight by the name of Saber. Together, they become the final participants in the fifth Holy Grail War, a free-for-all battle carried out by seven Servants and their summoners, with the prize being a magical device that can grant any wish.\n\nBased off the famous visual novel by Type-Moon, Fate/Stay Night chronicles the trials and challenges that Shirou faces as he enters a battle that he knew nothing about, but that may very well lead him towards the path of becoming a hero like his fatherâ€¦ if he survives, that is.",
