    "synopsis": "On Kobeni Yonomori’s 16th birthday, she gets something she was not expecting: a future husband and little sister-in-law to take care of. Hakuya Mitsumine was picked by Kobeni’s grandfather to be her fiance, and he and his sister Mashiro will be staying with Kobeni and her family from now on.\n\nKobeni is shocked that she is Engaged to the Unidentified, but takes this in stride, learning to live alongside a boy and little girl who she knows barely anything about. As she grows accustomed to this new life, though, she begins to learn more about the mysterious boy she has been paired up with.\n\nBetween the nearly invisible Hakuya, his deceptively mature-seeming sister, and Kobeni’s own perverted and obsessive older sister, Kobeni has her hands full. Will this arrangement turn into something beautiful, or dissolve into a broken promise?",
