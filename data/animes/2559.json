On the way to Milan he meets Alfredo, a mysterious boy on the run heading to the same fate. Upon being separated and sold to their new bosses, the two boys swear eternal friendship. Romeo has to learn the hardships of a chimney sweep's job. His boss' daughter, Angeletta, is a girl with a heart illness who is not allowed to leave her room.
