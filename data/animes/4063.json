    "synopsis": "It was a moment in the world’s history not recorded in any textbook. A spaceship crashed to Earth carrying within it a number of powerful, humanoid beings called Sekirei. Their physical and elemental powers are remarkable enough, but by kissing certain human individuals with special genes called Ashikabi, the Seikirei can form a bond with them that awakens a deeper power within the Sekirei themselves.",
