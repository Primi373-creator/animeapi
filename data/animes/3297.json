The girls have come far since they began their training, and they are slowly forming their own distinctive styles as tour guides for the city.\n\nOn the long journey towards their goal, the girls have relied on the advice of their seniors from their respective companies: the patient and understanding Alicia from Aria Company, the strict and proper Akira from Himeya Company, and the clumsy yet caring Athena from Orange Planet Company.\n\nWill the girls be able to blend the advice from their mentors with their personally acquired knowledge of Neo Venezia to become praiseworthy Prima Undines?\n\nWelcome once more to Neo Venezia; the city that personifies warmth and tranquility.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
