Shinji Ikari and his partner Rei Ayanami are assisted by two new pilots: the fiery Asuka Langley and the mysterious Mari Makinami.\n\nWith the aid of their mechanized Evangelion units, equipped with weapons perfect for engaging their monstrous opponents, the four young souls fight desperately to protect their loved ones and prevent an impending apocalypse.
