    "synopsis": "The Cat Returns is something of a loose spin-off of \"Whisper of the Heart\" as it features two characters from that film: Muta (the cat from \"Whisper\") and the Baron (the cat statue from \"Whisper\"). There is no other connection between the two movies and this is not a sequel. The story is based on Neko no Danshaku (The Cat Baron) by Hiiragi Aoi.",
