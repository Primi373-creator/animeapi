    "synopsis": "The discovery of a hypergate on the Moon once allowed the human race to teleport to Mars. Those who chose to settle there unearthed a technology far more advanced than that of their home planet, which they named \"Aldnoah.\" This discovery led to the founding of the Vers Empire of Mars and a declaration of war against the \"Terrans,\" those who stayed behind on Earth. However, a battle on the moon—later called \"Heaven's Fall\"—caused the hypergate to explode, destroying the moon and leading the two planets to establish an uneasy ceasefire.",
