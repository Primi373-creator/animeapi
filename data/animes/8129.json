She might also not be quite what she seems to be…\n\nWith the help of her new friend Tsukimi becomes confident enough to take on the world, protect her home from destruction, and attempt to achieve her life-long dream of becoming a designer. This little Kuragehime is on her way to becoming a queen.",
