    "synopsis": "Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the \"Shadow King\" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka \"Honey\" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy.",
