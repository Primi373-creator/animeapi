    "synopsis": "The story is set in a fictional world in which normal people and supernatural beings called youmu coexist. These creatures can be found in various shapes and sizes, and even though they are mostly harmless, some of them can be very dangerous and feral.\n\nThings start changing when Akihito Kanbara, a high school student who is half youmu, meets a girl named Mirai Kuriyama, who is a spirit hunter with the rare ability to manipulate her own blood. Mirai is very wary of youmu in general so she attacks Akihito, but gets surprised when she sees that his power is being able to heal quickly, making him almost invulnerable. They soon realize that they will need each other's help in order to survive the attacks of dangerous monsters that are coming their way. Will these two very different people be able to work together towards a common goal?",
