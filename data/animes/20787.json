    "synopsis": "The year is 2021. An unexpected and highly parasitic virus has devastated human society. The virus, known only as “Gastrea”, has driven humans into massive walled cities. The only thing that is capable of withholding the virus infected monsters is a metal called Varanium. The city walls and the weapons mankind uses to fight against these monsters are made of it. Despite efforts to keep \"Gastrea\" at bay, children were soon born with the virus already inside of them. Children born with the virus were called \"Cursed Children\", were only female and had special powers which humanity deemed as their best weapon to fight against Gastrea monsters.",
