A strange nun, members of the student council and other new faces make an appearance, causing Kodaka Hasegawa's life to grow even busier.\n\nWhile they all enjoy going to the amusement park, playing games, celebrating birthdays, and challenging the \"school festival\"—a symbol of the school life normal people live—the relations amongst the members slowly begins to change...\n\nLet the next stage begin, on this unfortunate coming-of-age love comedy!!\n\n(Source: ANN)",
