    "synopsis": "The student council of Hekiyou Gakuen is chosen by popular vote, so of course all the members are cute girls. All except Ken Sugisaki, that is. Ken managed to get a spot by being the top scoring student in his year, which granted him an automatic seat. It wasn’t an easy feat, as Ken is not exactly book-smart, but he studied hard and improved his score just to become a part of the exclusive student council.",
