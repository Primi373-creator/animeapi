    "synopsis": "Kokoro Connect is about the not-so-ordinary lives of the members of the Cultural Research Club of Yamaboshi High School. Seemingly without reason and without warning, the five club members suddenly find themselves randomly switching bodies with each other.

And in the center of these supernatural events is the mysterious Heartseed...",
