    "synopsis": "Formerly an all-girl school, Ousai Academy has recently gone co-ed. Enter student council vice president Takatoshi Tsuda, one of Ousai's first male students. He's adapting rather well now that he's in his second year, but there's still a lot to get used to. For example, what do girls talk about when there aren't any guys around? In Seitokai Yakuindomo*, pretty much exactly what you'd expect: sex!\n\nAlthough charged with upholding morality among the student body, the Ousai Student Council is notoriously perverted, especially president Shino Amakusa. As they carry out their duties to the school, Tsuda, Shino, and their fellow council members must balance curiosity with decency and sex jokes with studying. It takes a perv to know one, after all!",
