    "synopsis": "Leonardo Watch is living a pleasant, normal and slightly boring life with his parents and older sister, pursuing his photography hobby. But in an incident that changes everything, he receives the \"All-seeing Eyes of the Gods\" at the cost of his sister's eyesight. Desperate to help her, he goes to Hellsalem's Lot, the former New York City, now a war zone teeming with monsters from the Beyond—creatures from another dimension who entered through the portal which mysteriously opened between worlds. So, who's in charge of trying to maintain order in this melting pot of paranormal chaos and keeping it from spreading to the rest of the world?\n\nLIBRA is a motley crew of eccentrics and superhumans. When Leo joins their ranks, his suddenly tumultuous life gets crazier than ever. Werewolves, ancient vampires, beautiful ghosts, lonely mushrooms—Hellsalem's Lot has a little bit of everything, all of it bizarre. Kekkai Sensen is the story of Leonardo Watch and his journey through the strangest place on Earth.",
