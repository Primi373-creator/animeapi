    "synopsis": "The SAI Corporation has achieved great fame for its human-like androids. Called Giftia, these robots are programmed with a synthetic soul and serve many purposes in society. There’s just one flaw: a Giftia can live only 81,920 hours (about nine years and four months) before their memories and personality fade from existence, and they become potentially violent.",
