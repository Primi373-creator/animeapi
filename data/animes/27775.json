    "synopsis": "The SAI Corporation has achieved great fame for its human-like androids. Called Giftia, these robots are programmed with a synthetic soul and serve many purposes in society. There’s just one flaw: a Giftia can live only 81,920 hours (about nine years and four months) before their memories and personality fade from existence, and they become potentially violent.\n\nThat’s where Tsukasa Mizugaki comes in. After failing his college entrance exams, Mizugaki lands a job at the SAI Corporation’s Terminal Service Department, whose purpose is to reclaim these “expired” Giftia. Surrounded by expired Giftia and assisted by his Giftia work partner, the beautiful, innocent and inexperienced Isla, Mizugaki must come to terms with the short lifespan of these incredibly life-like androids in Plastic Memories.",
