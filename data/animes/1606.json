    "synopsis": "Sumimura Yoshimori is a Kekkaishi—an inheritor of the power to battle demons, using barriers called kekkai. His family is charged with protecting the grounds of Karasumori high school, a building which magnifies the power of demons who enter it. Helping him are his spirit-wolf companion Madarao, and next door-neighbor Yukimura Tokine, the daughter of a rival clan. Years ago, Tokine was injured protecting Yoshimori, and now he is determined to become strong enough to keep her from being hurt again. Of course, he'd rather bake his exquisite cakes than have to fight demons at all, but fate has something else in store! As a shadowy demon organization moves to steal Karasumori's power, can Yoshimori overcome legions of demons, a centuries-old family rivalry, and a grandfather who just can't understand his love for baking?\n\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",
