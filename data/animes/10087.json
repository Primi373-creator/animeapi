    "synopsis": "With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. In spite of that, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated \"Magus Killer\" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.",
