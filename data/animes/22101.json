    "synopsis": "In the almighty Sun Kingdom, it never rains. In the Rain Dukedom, select women of the royal family have the ability to call the rain with song. So when the most powerful ruler in the world, the Sun King Livius Orvinus Ifrikia, decides it's time to take a wife, it only makes sense that he demand to marry one of the four princesses of the Rain Dukedom, an offer they can't refuse.\n\nNike Remarcier is the youngest of the Rain princesses, and the one who inherited the ability to call the rain. Reluctantly, she journeys from her homeland to the Sun Kingdom, but when she meets the Sun King - the man who conquered the world in three short years - Nike is stunned to find that Livius I is only twelve years old. Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is the tale of this mismatched pair, and what happens when each discovers the other is a very different person than they expected.",
