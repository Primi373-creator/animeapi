    "synopsis": "When Ryu Yamada entered high school, he wanted to turn over a new leaf and lead a productive school life. That's why he chose to attend Suzaku High, where no one would know of his violent delinquent reputation. However, much to Ryu's dismay, he is soon bored; now a second year, Ryu has reverted to his old ways—lazy with abysmal grades and always getting into fights.",
