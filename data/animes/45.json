Will this legendary assassin and his band of heroic warriors be able to stop these rising threats and maintain Japan's peaceful era?\n\nRurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan is an enticing action series that explores historical themes through the eyes of the main protagonist, Kenshin, who has seen both good and evil.
