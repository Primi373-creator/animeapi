    "synopsis": "Another year begins at the Rabbit House cafe! After moving from her old town for a change of scenery, high school student Kokoa Hoto works at the cafe as a waitress to pay for room, board, and school. Her coworkers include cute middle schooler Chino Kafuu and constantly armed Rize Tedeza, and her friends work at coffee shops around town. Although it's not the rabbit cafe Kokoa once thought it was, life at the Rabbit House is turning out to be quite enjoyable.\n\nAlong with Sharo Kirima and Chiya Ujimatsu, Kokoa balances work with play, keeping the shop running while studying for exams and staying in touch with her family. During her work study program, she'll meet struggling novelists and mysterious creatures alike, including Tippy, Chino's \"special\" pet rabbit. What's the story behind the talking bunny? Can Kokoa and company keep Rabbit House in business? And will the taciturn Chino finally look up to her as a big sister?",
