    "synopsis": "Two men suddenly arrive within a bar without any knowledge of how they got there. They're not alone either. A man stands before them, dressed as a bartender, informing them that there is no way out unless they participate in a game of billiards. The terms of the game are not explicitly stated, though if they refuse to play at all the bartender reveals to them a room full of suspended corpses, with the implication that they will be set to join them if they don’t start the game within an hour.",
