    "synopsis": "A young boy named Satoshi embarks on a journey to become a \"Pokemon Master\" with his first Pokemon, Pikachu. Joining him on his travels are Takeshi, a girl-obsessed Rock Pokemon Trainer, and Kasumi, a tomboyish Water Pokemon Trainer who may have a crush on him. Satoshi and Co. end up traveling through various regions, including Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto, and then enter the Pokemon League competitions there. Along the way, they run into many confrontations with Musashi, Kojirou, and Nyarth, a trio of Pokemon thieves who are apart of an evil organization called \"Team Rocket.\" But every time Team Rocket tries to do their evil deeds, they fail thanks to Satoshi and his Pokemon.",
