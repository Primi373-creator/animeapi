    "synopsis": "Teenage romance is never easy, but it's especially difficult for second-year high school student Hase Yuuki. The girl he's fallen for, Fujimiya Kaori, is beautiful and kind, and was once the most popular girl in school. But now, she spends all her time alone, and the reason why is stranger and more painful than Yuuki could ever have imagined.\n\nFujimiya Kaori has a secret: due to an accident she suffered in middle school, she loses all her happy memories at the beginning of the week. As a result, Kaori keeps to herself, unwilling to endure the pain starting a friendship will cause both to her and to the other party. But when Yuuki-kun determinedly pushes his way into her life, Kaori finds herself drawn to him in spite of herself. Can kindness and caring overcome tragedy, and can Kaori and Yuuki become more than one week friends?",
