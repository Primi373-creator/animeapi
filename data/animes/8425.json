    "synopsis": "Victorique de Blois is so beautiful that when Kazuya Kujou first meets her he thinks she must be a doll. Victorique might look like a gothic lolita beauty, but she’s much rougher around the edges than she appears. She smokes a pipe, skips class, and solves crimes, none of which are fitting pastimes for a young lady in 1924 Europe.",
