Shido's step-sister, Kotori, tells him that the girl is called \"Special Disasterous Designated Creature: Spirit\", which causes a timespace quake. Kotori disclosed that she is the commander of the anti-spirit organization Ratatosk and orders him to go out on a date with the spirit girl. Kotori says, \"I don't ask you to beat the spirit. Just let her fall in love with you and save the world.\"\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
