These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire \"hero points.\" Their activities are documented on the popular program \"Hero TV,\" which picks the \"King of Heroes\" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
