    "synopsis": "Michiko is a stunning escaped convict with lethal looks and a deadly disrespect for the lawmen trying to hunt her down. Hatchin is a hapless orphan pushed to the breaking point by the sadistic spawn of her fiendish foster parents. On their own, these ladies are nothing more than a Yin searching for its Yang, but when fate—in the form of a mysterious man from their past—brings them together, the world better watch out! With the future dead ahead and the police hot on their heels, Michiko and Hatchin burn rubber through exotic locales where danger lurks around every corner. It's two against the world in this sun-soaked, Latin-tinged tale of partners in crime who won't stop running till they chase down a dream.\n\n(Source: FUNimation)",
